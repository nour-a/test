        <p>WThis family contains the largest butterflies in the world, including the birdwings of the Troides and Ornithoptera, the latter including Queen Alexandra's Birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae), the largest butterfly in the world.<a href="http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/family.php?name=Papilionidae" target="_blank">read more</a></p>

        <h2><ins>Family: Hesperiidae</ins></h2>
        <p>OOn a worldwide basis, approximately 3,500 of the 18,000 species of butterfly belong to this family, which is often referred to as the skippers since adults are characterised by their rapid and darting flight. In some species the adults rest with the forewings and hindwings in different planes, a characteristic never found in other families.<a href="http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/family.php?name=Hesperiidae" target="_blank">read more</a></p>

        <h2><ins>Family: Pieridae</ins></h2>
        <p>The Pieridae are found in all zoogeographical regions and comprise approximately 2,000 species, most of which are bivoltine. Adult butterflies are typically of a moderate size and exhibit sexual dimorphism. All butterflies are mostly white or yellow in colour and newly-emerged adults may give off a faint perfume.<a href="http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/family.php?name=Pieridae" target="_blank">read more</a></p>

        <h2><ins>Family: Nymphalidae</ins></h2>
        <p>The Nymphalidae is a family of several thousand species found in all zoogeographical regions of the world. Most are medium or large in size, but the family is highly variable given that it also includes the Satyrinae, a subfamily that has been designated as a family in its own right in earlier classifications.<a href="http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/family.php?name=Nymphalidae" target="_blank">read more</a></p>

        <h2><ins>Family: Riodinidae</ins></h2>
        <p>his family is primarily a South American group where the number of species is vast, although there is some representation in tropical Asia and Africa and a single species, the Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina) in Europe. The striking metallic colours of many of the species in this family have resulted in this family being known as the "metalmarks". <a href="http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/family.php?name=Riodinidae" target="_blank">read more</a></p>

        <h2><ins>Family: Lycaenidae</ins></h2>
        <p>The Lycaenidae is a family comprising several thousand species, the majority of which are small in size and with a rapid flight. Many are brilliantly coloured, and this is often the result of interference effects caused by the microstructure of the wings.<a href="http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/family.php?name=Lycaenidae" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
